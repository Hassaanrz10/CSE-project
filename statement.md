PROBLEM STATEMENT-
Let’s be real—most students and young professionals spend way more time on social media than they think. It’s easy to lose track, bouncing between apps without noticing the hours slipping by. 
Before you know it, your productivity tanks,
time gets away from you, and scrolling turns into a full-blown habit.
That’s why this project digs into weekly social media usage. By looking at the data stored in straightforward arrays, we can spot the signs of addiction, figure out which apps steal the most attention, and put all those screen-time trends into clear visuals.


Project Scope-
This project digs into tracking and analyzing how people use social media—nothing fancy, just arrays and simple Python. No outside databases, no high-tech data structures.
Here’s what it does:
You’ll collect how many minutes you spend each day on different social apps.
It spots when you’re on your phone the most.
If your usage crosses certain lines, it’ll flag that as a sign of addiction.
It points out which apps pull your attention the most.
You get a weekly summary and a simple graph showing your screen time.
All the insights come straight from basic array work and straightforward Python code.
What it doesn’t do:
It won’t grab real-time data from your phone.
No cloud storage, no user logins.
Forget about machine learning or predictions.
It’s not built for more than one user at a time.

Target Users-
This app’s for students who want to get a grip on their social media habits. It’s also handy for professionals who care about digital wel
lbeing and want to see their patterns. Parents can use it too—if they’re willing to enter the data—to keep an eye on basic usage trends. 
And if you’re going for a digital detox, there are simple tools here for tracking your progress
